          <h2 class="mb-5">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <div class="resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
            <div class="resume-content mr-auto">
           <h3 class="mb-0">What are some of the resources available to MIDN on the Yard?</h3>
              <p> There are a bunch of academic resources available daily on the Yard! A few examples are MGSP, Academic Center Reviews, Laboon Tutoring, Professor guided reviews, and even your peers can be great resources!</a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">What are the hours for the Laboon tutoring center?</h3>
              <p> Tutoring goes up in Laboon Sunday through Thursday between the hours of 2000 and 2200.</a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">How do I register for Supplemental Instruction classes?</h3>
              <p> For all supplemental instruction courses, Registration is through the USNA starfish portal listed above. </a></p>
            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">What is the criteria for being UNSAT?</h3>
			  <p> The criteria for being UNSAT is as follows: Two D's, 1 F, and or having below a 2.0 QPR.</a></p>            
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">I just failed my test / exam... Is there any hope for my QPR?</h3>
			  <p> Nothing is finalized until the end of the semester! Although you may have not performed as expected during 6 or 12 weeks, that does not mean your grade is set in stone. Numerous people have transformed low F's into high C's by the end of the semester. It all depends on your effort.</a></p>            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">I am a plebe and have NO idea what I want to select as a major. What should I do?</h3>
			  <p> Be sure to attend all majors breifs, in addition to talking to people in the major. Most majors have open houses or fairs to try and show you what each major entails. A general rule of thumb amongst MIDN is to pick something that interests you based on your abilities, as well as choose something you will enjoy doing late at night. </a></p>            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">During my time in high school, I never struggled with anything academically, but after seeing how this semester is going, I am on track to get my very first "C". Additionally, I am reluctant to ask my professor for help since I have never struggled with school before. Any suggestions?</h3>
            <p> Despite your academic success in high school, there will be situations here at USNA that will cause you to fail. My suggestion for you is to talk to your professor! Your professors might be intimidating at first, but at the end of the day, they are here to help you commission. Some professors will even come in after office hours for EI and other reviews. All you have to do is make the first move. </a></p>
			</div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">I got stuck with a "Bad" professor and the way he presents material does not help me learn. Is there anything I can do?</h3>
			<p> At the end of the day, all you can do is try your best. In addition to the resources above, you can always ask your peers for their notes from class if they have a better professor, or even reach out to other professors and see if they would be willing to help you.</a></p>            
		  </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">It is 2000 at night and I still have to write a paper on (insert some topic here) that is due tomorrow, except I have no idea where to start. What should I do?</h3>
			<p> In the future, really try and start the essay earlier instead of waiting to the last minute. Luckily for you, the Writing Center at Nimitz is here help! At the writing center, professional tutors and your peers are available nightly by appointment and by walk in. The people at the writing center can assist you at any point in your paper, from a outline to a final draft. Appointments are reccomended!</a></p>            </div>
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">What is Plagiarism? </h3>
             <p> Plagiarism is the act of stealing another person’s thoughts or ideas without providing a proper citation of where you pulled your ideas from. Plagiarism can also include misrepresenting information, in which the author would leave out key details from his work to have it appear as if it were their own. In addition, Plagiarism involves any idea that is published in a work that can not be defended as common knowledge. It is impertive to verify that the work being submitted is your own work, and that any help you recieved from other sources is authorized and documented.</a></p>
           </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">How do I change my major?</h3>
			  <p> If your truly want to change your major, you will need to meet with your academic adviser in order to develop a plan for your specific situation. Although major changes differ on a case by case basis, the key is to start the process early.</a></p>            
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">Where can I find my schedule for my final exams?</h3>
			  <p> Your final exam schedule is available via the MIDS portal. Once at the portal, click on "Academic Dean" and then "Final Exams - Query Midshipmen Schedule "</a></p>            
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">I have a final three days after my other finals. Is there a way I can take the test at an earlier date?</h3>
			  <p> This situation can best be answered by talking with your professor. Some professors will make an exception and allow you to come during another period and do it, while others will not.</a></p>            
          </div>
		  <h3 class="mb-0">How do I drop a class?</h3>
			  <p>Talk to your academic adviser. Additionally, you need to check the USNA academic calendar to be sure that you did not miss the course drop deadline.</a></p>
